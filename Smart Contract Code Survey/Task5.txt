//Suppose that your colleagues have developed this smart contract to be deployed on the Binance Smart Chain (EVM compatible) to swap between PancakeSwap and BakerySwap and to keep the arbitrage profits in BNB (Binance token). The goal of the contract is to take out a flash loan, and use that flash loan to profit from some arbitrage opportunities on PancakeSwap.
 
//You are asked to do a code review to maintain the quality of the code. Please review the code and then 1) identify any areas for improvement, and 2) revise the code accordingly (if needed).
